Here is the public repository for our paper, "ADAMAS: Adaptive Domain-Aware Performance Anomaly Detection in Cloud Service Systems," which was accepted by ICSE 2025, Research Track. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and domain knowledge-aware approach to detecting performance anomalies in different services.

## Overview

The following figure shows an overview of our ADAMAS framework, an adaptive performance anomaly detection framework incorporating domain knowledge.
