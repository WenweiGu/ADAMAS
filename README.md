## Datasets

We only put one sample of our industrial dataset and AIOps18 dataset here (due to the limit of space). However, upon acceptance of this work, we will release all datasets used in our study, including raw data and all labels, and any other relevant materials necessary for replication and analysis of our findings.

## Requirements

Python $\geq$ 3.8 is needed. Besides, the environment can be built by:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Run the code
Cd to ADAMAS/ and simply run:
```python ADAMAS_demo.py```
